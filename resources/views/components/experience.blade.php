                    My first-ever job, both in life and in the tech field, <br>
                    was an invaluable experience for me. It served as a <br>
                    platform where I not only gained knowledge about <br>
                    various job aspects but also honed my programming <br>
                    skills during my free time working there.

                <p>
                    In my first developer role, I gained comprehensive <br>
                    knowledge and skills through hands-on experience. <br>
                    One notable project was creating a digital signature <br>
                    proof of concept. I developed both the backend and <br>
                    frontend components, refining my skills and gaining <br>
                    practical experience in building secure software.

                    After a successful internship, I landed a full-stack <br>
                     developer job with diverse projects, including <br>
                     government initiatives. This role offered daily real- <br>
                     world challenges that enhanced my skills and <br>
                     knowledge. Working full-time as a developer fueled <br>
                     my professional growth and expertise in the field.
